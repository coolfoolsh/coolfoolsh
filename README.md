- 👋 Hi, this is a fool, a real fool, albeit a bit cool sometimes somehow somewhat somewhere.
- 👀 I ain't a computer geek, though I know a little about how computer and internet work.
- 🌱 I’m seeking the ways to get around the Great Wall without involving too complicated details.
- 💞️ I’m looking, too, for the techniques that can help me fly freely and free on websites and locate priceless true information. 
- 📫 Please do lend a hand at coolfool_sh@hotmail.com if you are kind.
